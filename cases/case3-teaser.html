            Together with the founder, we developed a unique approach for web3 user attribution by analyzing traditional analytics methods and creating strong value proposition for product companies. I created a consistent design system that enabled organized and predictable user experience throughout the platform, while maintaining the complexity required for analytics interfaces.

            Beyond the core product, I established WOMBI's market presence through distinctive branding with AI-generated wombat mascots and a strategic landing page. Our market research improved customer targeting, which led to better community engagement and sales growth.
