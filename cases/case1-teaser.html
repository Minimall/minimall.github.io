            After delivering a successful proof-of-concept for a major enterprise client, I led the end-to-end redesign of their core platform experience â€“ streamlining AI agent configuration, creating an integrated testing environment, and optimizing user acquisition flows. This strategic transformation helped Datrics secure several Fortune 500 clients and establish their enterprise market fit.

            Working alongside founders and key engineers, I shaped platform improvements across all critical areas: reimagining AI interaction patterns, validating enterprise-grade concepts, and building a scalable design system that balanced power with simplicity.
