            In early 2022, when Web3 was at its peak, my founder friend invited me to help shape their vision for a better analytics platform. Working with a small team of engineers, I took ownership of the entire product experience: from crafting the strategy and core UX, to building a practical design system with TailwindUI, to creating a unique brand identity featuring AI-generated wombat mascots.
          </p>
          <p>
            We launched the MVP in just 6 months, gaining our first paying customers and growing community engagement. While the crypto winter affected the platform's growth trajectory, we proved that a small team could ship a complex analytics product efficiently.
