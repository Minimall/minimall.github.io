            In early 2023, I partnered with the founding team to modernize their ember.js-based product through a systematic redesign approach. I established a foundational design system and led the redesign of their most technically complex section - Estimates & Invoices. Within three months, I delivered a comprehensive component library, technical documentation, and interactive prototypes that balanced design innovation with technical constraints.

            The project resulted in a scalable design foundation that supported Cinderblock's growth plans while maintaining their core value of practical usability. My work established patterns for future product development in the contractor-focused software space.
