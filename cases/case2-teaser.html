            In early 2023, I partnered with the founding team to modernize their Ember.js-based product, focusing on the complex Estimates & Invoices section. Within three months, I built a comprehensive component library in Figma with documentation and interactive prototypes that respected technical constraints.

            The project resulted in a scalable design system that supported Cinderblock's growth plans while maintaining their core value of practical usability. My work established patterns for future product development for both web & mobile, and helped Cinderblock grow to a global marketplace.
