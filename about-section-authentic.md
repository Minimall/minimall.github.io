# About

Growing up in Kharkiv, I spent every summer visiting my grandmother in Bilopillia, a small Ukrainian city near the Russian border (now heavily damaged by Russian attacks). While city kids around me were playing outside, I was already fascinated by technology, spending hours exploring computers whenever I could get my hands on one.

At 13, my older friend gave me a stack of tech magazines. Inside were images of MacBooks and smartphones, but what really got me excited was GarageBand's interface – those perfectly crafted skeuomorphic buttons and virtual instruments that looked both realistic and futuristic. With an HTML textbook he also gave me, I started staying after school in the computer lab, creating my first websites in Notepad.exe. I still remember being amazed by the <marquee> tag – imagine, text moving across the screen just like those LED displays!

In 2005, my grandmother passed away. She had been secretly saving money, which my mom used to buy me my first computer – an AMD-powered Windows PC with a CRT monitor. Three months later, I had it running as a Hackintosh, carefully picking compatible components to run macOS perfectly. It wasn't just about using Apple's software; I wanted to understand how everything worked from the inside out.

This curiosity led me to launch a local website sharing mobile content, and then to my first design job at meta.ua when I was 18. That same year, my friend got an original iPhone – before they were even officially available in Ukraine. We spent hours jailbreaking it to work with local carriers, adding Russian localization, installing Cydia and games before the App Store existed. Every new feature we unlocked felt like discovering a small piece of the future.

The 2008 financial crisis ended my time at meta.ua, but by then I was hooked. While studying, I joined the team developing rozetka.ua, which would become Ukraine's largest online retailer. My fascination with Apple's approach to design helped us win a contract to develop mobile banking apps when smartphones were just starting to change how people interacted with their banks.

This early experience with banking apps opened another door. I joined EPAM and found myself working directly in Ryanair's Dublin office, alongside Michael O'Leary and his team, redesigning their check-in interface. It was there, on a massive office screen in late 2013, that I watched the Revolution of Dignity unfold in Kyiv – a surreal experience of witnessing my country's history while working on a project that would impact millions of European travelers.

My journey continued at GlobalLogic in Kharkiv, where I grew from a hands-on designer to leading a team of 30+ designers across the CEE region. We were building design systems for healthcare platforms and enterprise solutions, each project adding new layers of complexity and learning. Then February 2022 came, and with the full-scale invasion, I had to evacuate first to Lviv, then to Kyiv, coordinating the team remotely and ensuring our work continued despite everything.

These challenges led me to explore new territories. First with web3 analytics at WOMBI, then with job management systems at Cinderblock, and now with AI Data Analyst platforms at Datrics. Each project pushed me to think differently about how we make complex systems accessible and useful.

# Today

Seventeen years later, I still carry that same curiosity about technology and design, now enhanced by deep experience with complex technical products. My focus has evolved from crafting interfaces to architecting entire product experiences, particularly in domains where complexity meets user needs.

I work with teams who value both innovation and scalability. Whether it's making AI interfaces more intuitive, simplifying enterprise systems, or developing consumer products – I focus on finding elegant solutions to complex technical challenges.

In technical product design, I bring deep understanding of AI/LLM systems and their UX implications, experience with analytics platforms and data visualization, and expertise in enterprise SaaS and B2B/B2C products. My track record includes successful launches in emerging technologies like AI and Web3, where understanding both technical capabilities and user needs is crucial.

My leadership experience comes from building and scaling design teams across organizations, creating frameworks for design practice excellence, and establishing design systems and scalable processes. I dive deep into complex domains to ensure meaningful solutions, focusing on measurable business impact while combining strategic thinking with hands-on execution.

Currently based in Kyiv, I collaborate with teams worldwide, helping them transform complex technical requirements into products that users love. I'm particularly drawn to early-stage products where design can define success, and to complex technical challenges that require deep understanding. I value working with teams who understand that innovation and practical implementation must go hand in hand.

I'm open to both consulting on challenging projects and joining teams as Principal Designer or Design Director, especially in companies building technically complex products that require systematic thinking and careful design approach.
