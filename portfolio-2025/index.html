                        Growing up in <span class="hover-word" data-images="kharkiv1.jpg,kharkiv2.jpg,kharkiv3.jpg" data-text="Kharkiv"><span class="wave-text">Kharkiv</span><img class="hover-image" alt="Kharkiv"></span> (Ukraine), I spent every summer visiting my grandmother in

                        border (now heavily damaged by Russian attacks). While
                        city kids around me were playing outside, I was already
                        fascinated by technology, spending hours exploring computers whenever I could get my hands on one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At 13, my older friend gave me a stack of tech
                        magazines. Inside were images of MacBooks and
                        smartphones, but what really got me excited was GarageBand's interface – those perfectly crafted skeuomorphic buttons and
                        virtual instruments that looked both realistic and
                        futuristic. With an HTML textbook he also gave me, I
                        started staying after school in the computer lab,
                        creating my first websites in Notepad.exe. I still
                        remember being amazed by the &lt;marquee&gt; tag:
                    </p>
                    <div class="marquee-container">
                        <div class="marquee">
                            imagine, text moving across the screen just like
                            those LED displays!
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In 2005, my grandmother passed away. She had been
                        secretly saving money, which my mom used to buy me my
                        first computer – an AMD-powered Windows PC with a CRT
                        monitor. Three months later, I had it running as a
                        Hackintosh, carefully picking compatible components to
                        run macOS perfectly. It wasn't just about using Apple's
                        software; I wanted to understand how everything worked
                        from the inside out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This curiosity led me to launch a local website sharing
                        mobile content, and then to my first design job at
                        meta.ua when I was 18. That same year, my friend got an
                        original iPhone – before they were even officially
                        available in Ukraine. We spent hours jailbreaking it to
                        work with local carriers, adding Russian localization,
                        installing Cydia and games before the App Store existed.
                        Every new feature we unlocked felt like discovering a
                        small piece of the future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 2008 financial crisis ended my time at meta.ua, but
                        by then I was hooked. While studying, I joined the team
                        developing rozetka.ua, which would become Ukraine's
                        largest online retailer. My fascination with Apple's
                        approach to design helped us win a contract to develop
                        mobile banking apps when smartphones were just starting
                        to change how people interacted with their banks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This early experience with banking apps opened another
                        door. I joined EPAM and found myself working directly in
                        Ryanair's Dublin office, alongside Michael O'Leary and
                        his team, redesigning their check-in interface. It was
                        there, on a massive office screen in late 2013, that I
                        watched the Revolution of Dignity unfold in Kyiv – a
                        surreal experience of witnessing my country's history
                        while working on a project that would impact millions of
                        European travelers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My journey continued at GlobalLogic in Kharkiv, where I
                        grew from a hands-on designer to leading a team of 30+
                        designers across the CEE region. We were building design
                        systems for healthcare platforms and enterprise
                        solutions, each project adding new layers of complexity
                        and learning. Then February 2022 came, and with the
                        full-scale invasion, I had to evacuate first to Lviv,
                        then to Kyiv, coordinating the team remotely and
                        ensuring our work continued despite everything.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These challenges led me to explore new territories.
                        First with web3 analytics at WOMBI, then with job
                        management systems at Cinderblock, and now with AI Data
                        Analyst platforms at Datrics. Each project pushed me to
                        think differently about how we make complex systems
                        accessible and useful.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Today</h2>

                    <p>
                        Seventeen years later, I still carry that same curiosity
                        about technology and design, now enhanced by deep
                        experience with complex technical products. My focus has
                        evolved from crafting interfaces to architecting entire
                        product experiences, particularly in domains where
                        complexity meets user needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I work with teams who value both innovation and
                        scalability. Whether it's making AI interfaces more
                        intuitive, simplifying enterprise systems, or developing
                        consumer products – I focus on finding elegant solutions
                        to complex technical challenges.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In technical product design, I bring deep understanding
                        of AI/LLM systems and their UX implications, experience
                        with analytics platforms and data visualization, and
                        expertise in enterprise SaaS and B2B/B2C products. My
                        track record includes successful launches in emerging
                        technologies like AI and Web3, where understanding both
                        technical capabilities and user needs is crucial.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My leadership experience comes from building and scaling
                        design teams across organizations, creating frameworks
                        for design practice excellence, and establishing design
                        systems and scalable processes. I dive deep into complex
                        domains to ensure meaningful solutions, focusing on
                        measurable business impact while combining strategic
                        thinking with hands-on execution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Currently based in Kyiv, I collaborate with teams
                        worldwide, helping them transform complex technical
                        requirements into products that users love. I'm
                        particularly drawn to early-stage products where design
                        can define success, and to complex technical challenges
                        that require deep understanding. I value working with
                        teams who understand that innovation and practical
                        implementation must go hand in hand.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm open to both consulting on challenging projects and
                        joining teams as Principal Designer or Design Director,
                        especially in companies building technically complex
                        products that require systematic thinking and careful
                        design approach.
