      Between 2020-2023, I teamed up with GetYourGuide on a variety of initiatives with the ultimate goal of improving conversion and engagement. We've touched every part of the consumer flow, from redefining the way trips are planned, to revamping their activity pages, to enhancing the way adventurers explore the world.

      GetYourGuide went on to become one of the largest travel businesses worldwide, and received over $1.1 billion in funding.
