      Upward came to me in the summer of 2023, while they were looking to find product market fit in an increasingly competitive market.
      I picked up on the work done by my friends at New York-based studio <strong>Related Works</strong> to explore potential futures
      for Upward and help them raise seed funding.

      I've worked closely with the CEO and VP of Engineering on every Upward touchpoint: helping them find product market fit, defining
      a long term vision, getting our first 10 corporate contracts & LOIs, designing and launching the MVP, and all fundraising
      materials.
