[short version]

I'm a Principal Product Designer with 17 years of experience in building complex technical products that feel simple and intuitive. I've led design for breakthrough AI platforms at Datrics, crafted enterprise systems at GlobalLogic, and shaped products for international companies like Ryanair.

I help teams bridge technical complexity with user needs – whether it's making AI accessible, simplifying analytics, or modernizing enterprise platforms. My work combines deep technical understanding with strategic design thinking, helping companies find elegant solutions to complex challenges.

Currently consulting with selected founding teams on critical evolution points where clear design vision accelerates market fit.

# About

Growing up in Kharkiv, I spent every summer visiting my **grandmother** in **Bilopillia**, a small Ukrainian city near the Russian border. While city kids around me were playing outside, I was already fascinated by technology, spending hours exploring computers whenever I could get my hands on one.

At 13, my older friend gave me a **stack of tech magazines**. Inside were images of MacBooks and smartphones, but what really got me excited was GarageBand's interface – those perfectly crafted skeuomorphic buttons and virtual instruments that looked both realistic and futuristic. With an **HTML textbook** he also gave me, I started staying after school in the **computer lab**, creating my first websites in Notepad.exe.

In 2005, my grandmother passed away. She had been secretly saving money, which my **mom** used to buy me my **first computer** – an AMD-powered Windows PC with a CRT monitor. Three months later, I had it running as a Hackintosh, carefully picking compatible components to run macOS perfectly. It wasn't just about using Apple's software; I wanted to understand how everything worked from the inside out.

This curiosity led me to launch a local website sharing mobile content, then to my first design role at meta.ua at 18. That same year, my friend got an original iPhone – before they were even officially available in Ukraine. Every new feature we unlocked felt like discovering a small piece of the future.

The path wasn't always straight. While studying, I joined the team behind rozetka.ua, which would become Ukraine's largest online retailer. Later, this mix of technical knowledge and design sensibility helped us pioneer mobile banking apps in Ukraine, when smartphones were still finding their place in our daily lives.

# How I Work

I partner with teams in two ways:

**Design Partner for Technical Products**
I help founding teams and established companies make complex technical products feel intuitive and accessible. From AI platforms to enterprise systems, I focus on finding elegant solutions to challenging problems.

**Strategic Design Lead**
I help organizations establish and scale their design practices, bringing systematic thinking to both product development and team operations.

My approach is built on several key principles:

**One Team**
I embed myself within your team, working as a true partner from kick-off to launch. Your goals become my goals, and I proactively look for ways to push the project forward.

**Prototype-Driven Development**
I believe the best way to understand something is by interacting with it. We'll spend more time with working prototypes than presentations, making decisions based on real experiences rather than theoretical discussions.

**Progress Over Perfection**
I share work early and often, focusing on continuous improvement rather than big reveals. This allows us to learn and adapt quickly, ensuring we're always moving in the right direction.

**Scaling With Your Needs**
Whether you need hands-on design work or strategic leadership, I adapt my involvement to match your requirements. I can work independently or bring in trusted collaborators for larger initiatives.

Based in Kyiv but working with teams worldwide, I'm selective about projects, choosing to work with companies where I can make a meaningful impact. I'm particularly drawn to challenges that require both technical depth and design excellence.

If you're building something complex that needs to feel simple, let's talk.
