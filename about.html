					<div class="main-text">
						<p>My journey into design began in <span data-hover="true" data-images="kharkiv1.webp,kharkiv2.webp,kharkiv3.webp">Kharkiv</span>, Ukraine, where my early fascination with technology was shaped by a stack of tech <span data-hover="true" data-images="magazines1.webp,magazines2.webp,magazines3.webp">magazines</span> my friend gave me when I was 13. Inside were images of MacBooks and smartphones, but what really got me excited was Mac OS X Tiger, and specifically <span data-hover="true" data-images="garageband.webp">GarageBand</span> UI – those perfectly crafted skeuomorphic buttons and virtual instruments that looked both realistic and futuristic. 

                    <p>Those magazines came with an HTML textbook, and I spent afternoons after school in the computer lab, creating my first websites. I still remember being amazed by the &lt;marquee&gt; tag: </p>

						<div class="marquee-container">
							<div class="marquee">imagine like text is sliding through display, same as LED boards! imagine like text is sliding through display, same as LED boards! imagine like text is sliding through display, same as LED boards! </div></div>


						<p>In 2005, my grandmother passed away in <span data-hover="true" data-images="bilopillya.webp">Bilopillya</span>, a small city near Ukraine's border (now <span data-hover="true" data-images="bilopillya2.webp,bilopillya3.webp,bilopillya4.webp">heavily damaged</span> by russian terrorist attacks). She had been secretly saving money, which my mom used to buy me my first computer – an AMD-powered <span data-hover="true" data-images="desktop.webp">Windows desktop</span>. Within few months, I had transformed it into a <span data-hover="true" data-images="macos.webp,macos2.webp,macos3.webp">Hackintosh</span>, finally able to explore macOS and GarageBand myself.</p>

						<p>These early days were filled with experimentation which led me to launch a local mobile content website, then landing my first design role at <a href="https://meta.ua" data-hover="true">meta.ua</a> at 18.</p>

						<p>That same year, my friend got an <span data-hover="true" data-images="iphone.webp">original iPhone</span> – before they were even officially available in Ukraine. We spent hours <span data-hover="true" data-images="jailbreak.webp">jailbreaking it</span> to work with local carriers, adding localization, installing Cydia and games before the App Store existed. Every new feature we unlocked felt like discovering a small piece of the future. Each story like this taught me how to make complex technology feel simple and accessible.</p>

						<p>Few years later, I joined the leading UX-focused bureau developing <a href="https://rozetka.ua" data-hover="true">rozetka.ua</a>, which would become Ukraine's largest online retailer. My fascination with Apple's approach to design helped us win a contract to develop mobile banking apps of <a href="https://pumb.ua" data-images="pumb-iphone.webp" data-hover="true">PUMB</a> for iOS and iPad, just as smartphones began to change how people interacted with their banks.</p>

						<p>After, I had a transformative experience working on the redesign of <a href="https://ryanair.com" data-hover="true">Ryanair</a> flight check-in UI at EPAM. Being in Dublin during that project was surreal, especially as I watched the <span data-hover="true" data-images="ryanair.webp,maidan.webp,maidan2.webp">Revolution of Dignity</span> unfold back home in 2014 — a powerful collision of my personal and professional worlds.</p>

						<p>Between 2014 and 2018, I drove UX for high-impact projects at <a href="https://plarium.com" data-hover="true">Plarium</a> — hailed as one of Facebook's best — where our browser games reached over 250 million players in 150 countries. Next, I transitioned into leadership at GlobalLogic, collaborating with international team and supporting over <span data-hover="true" data-images="gl.webp,gl2.webp,gl3.webp">30 designers</span> across CEE — even during the challenging times of a full-scale invasion of russia in 2022. </p>

						<p>During recent 3 years, I ventured into web3 with WOMBI — an analytics platform that tried to disrupt the user attribution process, and challenged traditional cosmic branding of web3 with a family of AI-generated wombat mascots. At <a href="https://cinderblock.com" data-hover="true">Cinderblock</a>, I refreshed the user flows for their job management platform ahead of a major marketing push. And at <a href="https://datrics.ai" data-hover="true">Datrics</a>, I currently lead design for an AI Data Analyst platform that transforms how businesses harness data insights.</p>

					<p>Seventeen years after my journey began, <span data-hover="true" data-images="2025.webp">I am</span> based in <span data-hover="true" data-images="kyiv1.jpg,kyiv2.jpg,kyiv3.jpg">Kyiv</span> 🇺🇦 while collaborating with teams worldwide. I'm selective about projects, choosing to work with companies where I can make a meaningful impact, and I'm particularly drawn to challenges that demand both technical depth and design excellence. </p>

						<p>Whether I'm designing AI interfaces, enterprise systems, or exploring generative design and AI coding co-pilots — I always bring the same curiosity and technical insight to every project.  </p>
