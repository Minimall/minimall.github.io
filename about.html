					<h1 class="headline">Me & my path</h1>

						<p>My journey into design began in <span data-hover="true" data-images="kharkiv1.jpg,kharkiv2.jpg,kharkiv3.jpg">Kharkiv</span>, Ukraine, where my early fascination with technology was shaped by a stack of tech <span data-hover="true" data-images="magazines1.jpg,magazines2.jpg,magazines3.jpg">magazines</span> my friend gave me when I was 13. Inside were images of MacBooks and smartphones, but what really got me excited was Mac OS X Tiger, and specifically <span data-hover="true" data-images="garageband.jpg">GarageBand</span> UI â€“ those perfectly crafted skeuomorphic buttons and virtual instruments that looked both realistic and futuristic. 

                    <p>Those magazines came with an HTML textbook, and I spent afternoons after school in the computer lab, creating my first websites. I still remember being amazed by the <span class="collapsible-link wave-text" data-hover="true">&lt;marquee&gt;</span> tag: </p>

						</div>

						<p>In 2005, my grandmother passed away in <span data-hover="true" data-images="bilopillya.jpg">Bilopillya</span>, a small city near Ukraine's border with Russia (now <span data-hover="true" data-images="bilopillya2.jpg,bilopillya3.jpg,bilopillya4.jpg">heavily damaged</span> by Russian attacks). She had been secretly saving money, which my mom used to buy me my first computer â€“ an AMD-powered <span data-hover="true" data-images="desktop.jpg">Windows desktop</span>. Within few months, I had transformed it into a <span data-hover="true" data-images="macos.jpg,macos2.jpg,macos3.jpg">Hackintosh</span>, finally able to explore macOS and GarageBand myself.</p>

						<p>These early days were filled with experimentation which led me to launch a local mobile content website, then landing my first design role at <a href="https://meta.ua" data-hover="true">meta.ua</a> at 18.</p>

						<p>That same year, my friend got an <span data-hover="true" data-images="kharkiv1.jpg">original iPhone</span> â€“ before they were even officially available in Ukraine. We spent hours <span data-hover="true" data-images="kharkiv1.jpg">jailbreaking it</span> to work with local carriers, adding localization, installing Cydia and games before the App Store existed. Every new feature we unlocked felt like discovering a small piece of the future. Each story like this taught me how to make complex technology feel simple and accessible.</p>

						<p>Few years later, I joined the leading UX-focused bureau developing <a href="https://rozetka.ua" data-hover="true">rozetka.ua</a>, which would become Ukraine's largest online retailer. Later, my fascination with Apple's approach to design helped us win a contract to develop mobile banking apps for iOS and iPad, just as smartphones began to change how people interacted with their banks.</p>

						<p>In 2013, I had a transformative experience working on the redesign of Ryanairâ€™s check-in interface at EPAM. Being in Dublin during that project was surreal, especially as I watched the Revolution of Dignity unfold back homeâ€”a powerful collision of my personal and professional worlds.</p>

						<p>Between 2014 and 2018, I drove high-impact projects at Plarium â€” hailed as one of Facebookâ€™s best â€” where our browser games reached over 250 million players in 150 countries. Next, I transitioned into leadership at GlobalLogic, collaborating with international teams and guiding over 30 designers â€” even during the challenging times of a full-scale invasion in 2022. Throughout this phase, my passion for simplifying complex systems never wavered.</p>

						<p>Seventeen years later, I still get excited about making complex technology feel simple and natural. Now, I expanded my consulting expertise across both startups and established companies, reimagining digital experiences and user interactions. Whether I'm designing AI interfaces or enterprise systems, I bring that same curiosity and technical understanding to every project.</p>

					<p>Based in Kyiv ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, but working with teams worldwide, I'm selective about projects, choosing to work with companies where I can make a meaningful impact. </p>

					<p>I'm particularly drawn to challenges that require both technical depth and design excellence. Whether it's making AI accessible, simplifying analytics, or modernizing enterprise platforms â€” I focus on finding elegant solutions to complex challenges.</p>

				Team
				</h1>
			<p>I embed myself within your team, working as a true partner from kick-off to launch. Your goals become my goals, and I proactively look for ways to push the project forward.</p>

			<h1 class="case-title">Prototype-Driven</h1>
			<p>I believe the best way to understand something is by interacting with it. We'll spend more time with working prototypes than presentations, making decisions based on real experiences rather than theoretical discussions.</p>

				<h1 class="case-title">Focus push</h1>

			<p>I share work early and often, focusing on continuous improvement rather than big reveals. This allows us to learn and adapt quickly, ensuring we're always moving in the right direction.</p>

				<h1 class="case-title">Scaling</h1>
			<p>Whether you need hands-on design work or strategic leadership, I adapt my involvement to match your requirements. I can work independently or collaborate closely a team of designers, engineers or strategists for larger initiatives.</p>
