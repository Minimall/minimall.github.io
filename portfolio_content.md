### Introduction
I design products, apps, and websites for startups & large orgs.

I'm a Product Design Lead with 17 years of experience in designing complex technical products that feel simple and intuitive. Currently I'm architecting product design for AI Agent Builder platform at [Datrics](https://datrics.ai) and advising tech startups across the world.

As a designer, I help teams bridge technical complexity with user needs â€“ whether it's making AI accessible, simplifying analytics, or modernizing enterprise platforms.

As a leader & manager, I've helped large orgs build happy & successful teams, and provided the right environment for designers to do the best work of their career.

### Recent Works

#### Datrics.ai
Datrics is an innovative startup helping enterprises build and deploy custom AI agents. I partnered with their team as Principal Product Designer to transform their technical platform into an intuitive enterprise solution.

- Startups
- Strategy
- Product Design

After delivering a successful proof-of-concept for a major enterprise client, I led the end-to-end redesign of their core platform experience â€“ streamlining AI agent configuration, creating an integrated testing environment, and optimizing user acquisition flows. This foundational work led to several more POCs and helped Datrics attract major B2B2C clients.

Together with the founding team and engineers, I designed a flexible design system that supported custom feature development for enterprise, and making complex features easy to use.

#### Cinderblock
Cinderblock is a job management platform helping contractors run their businesses efficiently. I joined their team as Lead Product Designer to guide a complete platform redesign ahead of a major marketing push.

- Startups
- Product Design

In early 2023, I partnered with the founding team to modernize their Ember.js-based product, focusing on the complex Estimates & Invoices section. Within three months, I built a comprehensive component library in Figma with documentation and interactive prototypes that respected technical constraints.

The project resulted in a scalable design system that supported Cinderblock's growth plans while maintaining their core value of practical usability. My work established patterns for future product development for both web & mobile, and helped Cinderblock grow to a global marketplace.

#### WOMBI
WOMBI is a pioneering platform for web3 user attribution analytics. As a Founding Product Designer, I shaped the product concept, designed core UI and created brand identity.

- Product Design

Together with the founder, we developed a unique approach for web3 user attribution by analyzing traditional analytics methods and creating strong value proposition for product companies. I created a consistent design system that enabled organized and predictable user experience throughout the platform, while maintaining the complexity required for analytics interfaces.

Beyond the core product, I established WOMBI's market presence through distinctive branding with AI-generated wombat mascots and a strategic landing page. Our market research improved customer targeting, which led to better community engagement and sales growth.

## About Me

### Personal Journey
My journey into design began in Kharkiv, Ukraine, where my early fascination with technology was shaped by a stack of tech magazines my friend gave me when I was 13. Inside were images of MacBooks and smartphones, but what really got me excited was Mac OS X Tiger, and specifically GarageBand UI â€“ those perfectly crafted skeuomorphic buttons and virtual instruments that looked both realistic and futuristic.

Those magazines came with an HTML textbook, and I spent afternoons after school in the computer lab, creating my first websites. I still remember being amazed by the &lt;marquee&gt; tag:

*imagine like text is sliding through display, same as LED boards!*

In 2005, my grandmother passed away in Bilopillya, a small city near Ukraine's border (now heavily damaged by russian terrorist attacks). She had been secretly saving money, which my mom used to buy me my first computer â€“ an AMD-powered Windows desktop. Within few months, I had transformed it into a Hackintosh, finally able to explore macOS and GarageBand myself.

These early days were filled with experimentation which led me to launch a local mobile content website, then landing my first design role at meta.ua at 18.

That same year, my friend got an original iPhone â€“ before they were even officially available in Ukraine. We spent hours jailbreaking it to work with local carriers, adding localization, installing Cydia and games before the App Store existed. Every new feature we unlocked felt like discovering a small piece of the future. Each story like this taught me how to make complex technology feel simple and accessible.

Few years later, I joined the leading UX-focused bureau developing rozetka.ua, which would become Ukraine's largest online retailer. My fascination with Apple's approach to design helped us win a contract to develop mobile banking apps of PUMB for iOS and iPad, just as smartphones began to change how people interacted with their banks.

After, I had a transformative experience working on the redesign of Ryanair flight check-in UI at EPAM. Being in Dublin during that project was surreal, especially as I watched the Revolution of Dignity unfold back home in 2014 â€” a powerful collision of my personal and professional worlds.

Between 2014 and 2018, I drove UX for high-impact projects at Plarium â€” hailed as one of Facebook's best â€” where our browser games reached over 250 million players in 150 countries. Next, I transitioned into leadership at GlobalLogic, collaborating with international team and supporting over 30 designers across CEE â€” even during the challenging times of a full-scale invasion of russia in 2022.

During recent 3 years, I ventured into web3 with WOMBI â€” an analytics platform that tried to disrupt the user attribution process, and challenged traditional cosmic branding of web3 with a family of AI-generated wombat mascots. At Cinderblock, I refreshed the user flows for their job management platform ahead of a major marketing push. And at Datrics, I currently lead design for an AI Data Analyst platform that transforms how businesses harness data insights.

Seventeen years after my journey began, I am based in Kyiv ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ while collaborating with teams worldwide. I'm selective about projects, choosing to work with companies where I can make a meaningful impact, and I'm particularly drawn to challenges that demand both technical depth and design excellence.

Whether I'm designing AI interfaces, enterprise systems, or exploring generative design and AI coding co-pilots â€” I always bring the same curiosity and technical insight to every project.

### What I Do

#### Zero to One Product Design
- Start-ups
- Solo founders
- Early stage companies

I act as a hands-on design partner for founding teams looking to ship the first iteration of their product to market, or for early stage companies struggling to find product market fit.

#### Design Leadership
- Scale-ups
- Mature organisations

I act as a fractional Design Manager / DesignOps for established companies looking for a go to resource for all things design leadership: from helping you define your hiring process, to finding and retaining great designers, to managing and mentoring them to do the best work of their career.

### Key Principles

#### Team
I embed myself within your team, working as a true partner from kick-off to launch. Your goals become my goals, and I proactively look for ways to push the project forward.

#### Prototype-Driven
I believe the best way to understand something is by interacting with it. We'll spend more time with working prototypes than presentations, making decisions based on real experiences rather than theoretical discussions.

#### Focus Push
I share work early and often, focusing on continuous improvement rather than big reveals. This allows us to learn and adapt quickly, ensuring we're always moving in the right direction.

#### Scaling
Whether you need hands-on design work or strategic leadership, I adapt my involvement to match your requirements. I can work independently or collaborate closely a team of designers, engineers or strategists for larger initiatives.
